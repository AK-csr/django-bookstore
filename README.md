This is a portfolio project for any employers looking to hire me.
It is a Django based website with its own user system, authentification, and security

I wrote this following the instructions in the book Django for Professionals by William S. Vincent.
I read this book to learn about the Django framework as well as to use Docker
This project demonstrated my ability to follow instructions, learn, code, and debug.
